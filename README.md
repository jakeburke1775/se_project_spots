# SPOTS

A photo sharing platform made by Jake Burke

## Description

The project features a mock-up of a social media image sharing platform. The pictures are displayed in a way that is responsive and user-friendly. See my video below for more information.

This project was prompted by tripleten as my first responsive web design.

The prompt was introduced as a figma design and rendered into a proper website.

## Technology Involved

- flexbox
- grid
- media queries
- face fonts
- proper file formatting
- bash and git terminal execution

## Deployment

This project is deployed by GitHub Pages.

## Future Development

The actual function of this design is a part of the curriculum and will be revisited in the near future. This project will need some hover effects, I will add animations, shadows to the cards, gradients, etc.

I plan to use this kind of design to portray concept art of the videogame I am also creating.

### Please Provide feedback:

I am unable to figure out why the like buttons are getting cropped on mobile screen size.
