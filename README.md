# SPOTS

A photo sharing platform made by Jake Burke

## Description

This project was prompted by tripleten as my first responsive web design. The project features a mock-up of a social media image sharing platform.

The prompt was introduced as a figma design and rendered into a proper website.

## Technology Involved

### HTML and CSS

- flexbox
- grid
- media queries
- face fonts
- proper file format
- bash and git terminal execution

## Deployment

This project is deployed by GitHub Pages.

## Future Development

The actual function of this design is a part of the curriculum and will be revisited in the near future. This project will need some hover effects, I will add animations, shadows to the cards, gradients, etc.

I plan to use this kind of design to portray concept art of the videogame I am also creating.

## Project Video

I plan on uploading a video after this upload iteration. I am currently in the airport and do not have the capability to record my voice.
