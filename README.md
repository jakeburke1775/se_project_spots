# SPOTS

A photo sharing platform made by Jake Burke

## Description

The project features a mock-up of a social media image sharing platform. The pictures are displayed in a way that is responsive and user-friendly. See my video below for more information.

This project was prompted by tripleten as my first responsive web design. Frequently this project is revisited to have features installed.

The prompt was introduced as a figma design and rendered into a proper website.

## Technology Involved
- HTML: Markup is done with proper element usage
- CSS: flexbox, grid, media queries, face fonts
- JavaScript: The posts are organized into an object model. the user is able to add, remove, and favorite posts and edit the profile. Form errors are responsive to user input and demonstrate a user-friendly experience.
- Git: proper file formatting and terminal execution is practiced

## Deployment

This project is deployed by GitHub Pages.

## Future Development

Backend development will be utilized in the future to save the changes when the user refreshes.
I plan to use this kind of design to portray concept art of the videogame I am also creating.
